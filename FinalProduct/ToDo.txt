# ask Tian/ James
# usage of digital pins 0 and 1? usage should be avoided in applications

# can we turn on a single 555 timer at a time in a 556 timer?

# using analog pins as digital pins 
    # https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalread/
    # https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/analog-input
    # analog pins are used for analog read, analog write is typically done using pwm signals - https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/#functions

# what is left to test
# 1. 2nd thermistor - code done
# 2. push button - code done including generating a single trigger signal per press of the button
# 3. LED sequence - as the temperature rises, light more LEDs with shift reg
# 4. LED flash for rising and falling running on dedicated 556 timer - connect vcc to arduino output? connect to the trigger pin
# 5. single buzzer for rising and falling running on dedicated 556 timer (2 555 timers) - connect vcc to arduino output? connect to the trigger pin
# 6. ultrasonic and LDR output -> using two buzzers/ two LEDs or buzzer and LED (should be able to run concurrently)
# 7. additional graphs -> code done

# shift reg usage
# 7 seg - 1 (chain for digit pins as well?)
# fan LEDs, flashing LED, LDR response, ultrasonic response - 1
# LED sequence - 1

# arduino pin usage
# 2 thermistors -       2 analog
# 1 LDR -               1 analog

# ultrasonic -          2 digital

# 7 seg -               7 digital

# fan LEDs -            4 digital
# flashing LED -        1 digital
# LDR response -        1 digital
# ultrasonic response - 1 digital

# LED sequence -        8 digital

# buzzer -              2 digital
